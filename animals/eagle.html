            The eagle is a bird of prey found throughout the world. Eagles are
            known for their sharp talons and strong beaks, which they use to
            hunt and feed on a variety of prey such as fish, small mammals, and
            other birds. They are also known for their keen eyesight, which
            allows them to spot prey from great distances. Eagles are often
            associated with strength, freedom, and independence, and are a
            symbol of national pride for many countries.
